### Intro

- **Developer evangelism is the purest form of sales done right**
- Developer evangelist is a role that is a change for developers, not for people coming from HR, PR or marketing. Your main job is still to code â€“ but this time examples, training materials and explanatory demos rather than live products.
- If something new comes out of your company that should get out to developers take it and access it like an outside developer would. Develop something with it, then document what you have developed and then start writing how you build the thing
