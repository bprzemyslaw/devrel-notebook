### Notes

- Product feedback
- Docs feedback
- Tooling feedback
- User feedback
- Roadmap advice
- Support pre-sales
- Writing docs for the API from the beginning is crucial
- Consolidate the core of feedback
- Go past the solution that customer is saying and reach the need
- Translate feedback to tasks
- We should advocate generally for open source software because it enables developers to be more creative and more productive
- When a developer first signs up for your API, you often have just one shot to show them value. Given enough competition, there are no second chances.

**Developer advocates build communities that generates new advocates**
