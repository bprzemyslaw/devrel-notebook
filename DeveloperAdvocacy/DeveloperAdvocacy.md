### Motivators

We don't want super users to do advocacy for free stuff

* **Identity** – the mechanisms for how we are able to display, share and take pride in the accomplishment of becoming a super user
* **Privileges** – the set of technical capabilities, access to, and engagement with the company, and opportunities to have their leadership sanctioned
* **Tangibles** – the “goods,” whether physical items, account credits, or invitations to special events

There are no lifetime memberships. Each member has to be reconsidered on a set time frame, no matter how good their contributions may be. This allows you to roll in new blood and remove inactive members. It also allows members who have stopped participating due to life circumstances a chance to step back and save face.

### Notes

- Product feedback
- Docs feedback
- Tooling feedback
- User feedback
- Roadmap advice
- Support pre-sales
- Writing docs for the API from the beginning is crucial
- Consolidate the core of feedback
- Go past the solution that customer is saying and reach the need
- Translate feedback to tasks
- We should advocate generally for open source software because it enables developers to be more creative and more productive
- When a developer first signs up for your API, you often have just one shot to show them value. Given enough competition, there are no second chances.
* A person who gave a piece of feedback should know what happened with their feedback and how was it used. That makes them feel heard and keeps them motivated to continue to share more meaningful feedback in the future.

**Developer advocates build communities that generates new advocates**
