# How to contribute to auth0-community repos

All repos in this organisation are open source projects. We welcome contributions of all forms! Came across a bug in any of our community repos? Have an idea for some kind of improvement? Below you can find some guidelines on how to contribute, so as to make it work for the whole community in the long run. These repos are community maintained, so we're all in this together! ü§úüèºü§õüèª

For now, this contribution guideline serves as a source of truth in terms of contributing to any of auth0-community repos. We are working on making the open-source contribution experience in these repos more smooth and we plan to implement a variety of improvements including changes to this file as well as adding contribution files to each repo at some point. In the meanwhile please refer to this one, if you want to start/continue contributing in the right way to these repos.

### Code of Conduct

Auth0-community organisation has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to which all contributors must adhere.

### Intro

Don't feel like you have enough security and identity experience but want to contribute some way? No worries! We've got you covered! Join our [developer community](https://community.auth0.com/) to see what others are working on. Having a look at different issues and PRs in [community repos](https://github.com/auth0-community) might also be helpful!

Finally, do not forget that there are not alone on this journey! Our [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/) are indeed a powerful tool, but hey! There are other contributors out there also asking questions and looking for answers!

### Security and identity

If you found any security vulnerabilities or identity-related issues, you should address them directly at community@auth0.com

### Pull requests

Wondering how PRs work in our community repos? Here's a quick rundown:

* Clone the repo
* Check out the README file for the project for information specific to that project
* Create yourself a branch out of master
  * Name it descriptively so that others can understand who is working here and what this specific branch will contain e.g. *superUser-tokenRetrieval-fix*
* Commit appropriate changes to your branch
  * Remember that commit messages are essential for navigating through branch changes
  * Feel free to branch out of your branch to propose new changes as long as it makes sense and will be clear for the reviewer
* Open a pull request and provide some description that you consider will be helpful for the reviewer. It can be anything from the issue or bug number associated with your change, to your implementation specifics
  * The more descriptive title of PR / issue the faster it will potentially get addressed
  * For faster tracking and more convenient review process, if you've discussed it before with someone in our community and you know who potentially can review your changes, add this person as an assignee to our PR
* Implement requested changes and eventually have your code merged by the reviewer. **Never merged your code yourself!**
  * To make sure we can ship quality code and create useful tools for whole community, before one's pull request can be merged, it needs approval from at least two reviewers

### Issues

Found a bug in community repo? Here's more on how to report that so the community can get it fixed as soon as possible:

* Open an issue and provide as detailed issue description as possible
* If you feel like posting any screenshots that you consider helpful, go for it
* Include what is your expected result and what actually happens
* Provide steps to reproduce the issue
* If you're having issue with some framework / language / tool specific version, please provide its version

For now refer to this process, but we're working on adding issue templates to all community repos. Stay tuned!

#### Old issues

If an issue has been out there open for more than 90 days, we close them automatically. The aim of it is to ensure that new issues can be tracked more easily and old issues that are no longer relevant are closed.

### Review

#### Timing

Each PR or issue review takes time, we kindly ask you to be patient for each other.

#### Core Merge Rule

To make sure we can ship quality code and create useful tools for whole community, before one's pull request can be merged, it needs approval from at least two people.

#### Review discussion

Reviews and feedback must be helpful and made towards improving the contribution as opposed to blocking it. Be open for constructive discussion and always try to explain your point of view. Respect the fact that you'll be working with people who potentially may have different approach than yours.

#### Labels

Whether it's about issues or PRs make use of labels, so that the rest of the community can prioritize and address those accordingly. Here are the labels that you can use:

* **bug**: Something isn't working
* **duplicate**: This issue or pull request already exist
* **fix**: Fix to code
* **help wanted**: Extra attention is needed
* **new feature**: New feature implementation suggestion
* **question**: Further information is requested
* **wontfix**: This will not be worked on

### Where can I go for help?

As mentioned above, if you need any kind of help, you can either contact us at community@auth0.com or go to [developer community](https://community.auth0.com/) to get your question a wider audience.
