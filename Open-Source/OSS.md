### Notes

- Documentation is highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities.
- Open source is the default when choosing software.

- Problems encountered in open-source:
  - Unresponsiveness
  - Dismissive responses
  - Unexplained rejection
  - Unwelcoming language or content
