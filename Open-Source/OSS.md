### Members

  - **Author**: The person/s or organization that created the project
  - **Owner**: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
  - **Maintainers**: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
  - **Contributors**: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
  - **Community Members**: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.
  
### Motivation

- Extrinsic motivators are great at getting people first exposure, but not for creating long term OSS contributors.
  
### WelcomingCommunity

- Make it easy for someone to use your project
- Clearly explain how to contribute
- When someone new lands on your project, thank them for their interest!
- Be responsive
- Be open-minded about the types of contributions you’ll accept
- Treat your README as a constitution

### Documentation

- No matter which stage you decide to open source your project, every project should include the following documentation:
    - Open source license
    - README
    - Contributing guidelines
    - Code of conduct
    
    - **LICENSE**: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
  - **README**: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.
  - **CONTRIBUTING**: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
  - **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
  - **Other documentation**: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.

### OSSProblems

- Problems encountered in open-source:
  - Unresponsiveness
  - Dismissive responses
  - Unexplained rejection
  - Unwelcoming language or content

### Notes

- Documentation is highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities.
- Open source is the default when choosing software.
- Don’t spam as many people as possible. Instead, target your efforts to communities that will benefit from knowing about your project
