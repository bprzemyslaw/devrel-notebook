### Notes

- Documentation is highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities.
- Open source is the default when choosing software.

- Problems encountered in open-source:
  - Unresponsiveness
  - Dismissive responses
  - Unexplained rejection
  - Unwelcoming language or content
- Donâ€™t spam as many people as possible. Instead, target your efforts to communities that will benefit from knowing about your project
  - No matter which stage you decide to open source your project, every project should include the following documentation:
    - Open source license
    - README
    - Contributing guidelines
    - Code of conduct
