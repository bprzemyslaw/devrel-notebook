# Developer Community

In terms of developer community the core question is: **are they customers or partners?**

* **Most communities are unnecessary to members**
* **Discussion build relationships and relationships build communities**
* **Community management is about nurturing conversations**
* **You need to explicitly ask your community for its needs**

### DeveloperWants

Developers want to:

- Find information quickly
- Have proof points
- Not face bad marketing

### CommunityPersonas

**One of the things that is invaluable in the community / developer relations space is to create a persona around who the audience is**

- **Consumers** in a community come with an expectation to be served: they attend events, at events they listen to speakers, in the online community they read or sometimes react to things, but usually only when it seems useful to them. If they don’t like something in the community, they complain or disengage. They feel that leading the community is someone else’s responsibility and they are mostly in the community for opportunistic reasons.

- **Co-creators** on the other hand actively shape events they go to or they help organize them. In discussions, both online and in person, they actively contribute new ideas and initiatives without expecting anything in return. If they don’t like something, they bring it up for discussion and provide new ideas and suggestions how to address it. If a conflict arises, they are willing to work through it. They invest their energy, time and money into the organization, because they feel that this community is partially also their own organization and therefore their responsibility to push it forward.

### CommunityMigration

When migrating a community to a new platform:

* **Phase 1** - get your team and top 1% active community members to populate with content
* **Phase 2** - invite all active members to participate in "beta" of new community
* **Phase 3** - invite everyone else

### CommunityLifecycle

### CommunityMemberJourney

**The journey of community member maturity**

Aware -> Engaged -> Achieved

**Measurements**
- Number of members Aware
- Number of members Engaged
- Number of members moving from Aware to Engaged
- Number of members Achieved
- Number of members moving from Engaged to Achieved

### CommunityGettingStarted

- Identify target devs
- Say goodbye to inactive members on a regular basis
- Minimum commitment is expected from each member so set minimum expectations
- Identify their interests and motivations
- Remove barriers to adoption

**Framework for launching communities - C.A.R.G.O**

* Acquisition
* Retention
* Goals
* Outcome

### ImportantQuestions

- What makes your community unique?
- How do you help every member who joins your community immediately experience your uniqueness?

**Offering a new space to connect is no longer compelling on its own -> Conducting member research is crucial**

### CommunityOnboarding

**Onboarding and keeping developers is key**

- Make them feel welcomed and comfortable
- Give specific, simple steps to get started
- Don't overwhelm with too much info/tasks
- Over time interact in multiple ways
- Convey the culture and voice

### IncreasingParticipation

- Recognition and status boost
- Access to more info, tools, resources
- More capabilities and control
- Swag, cool stuff

### SuccessMetrics

- What % of questions got answered?
- Reduction in number of reported bugs in software
- How many people are completing the trial and stay for more?

- Is traffic to your community going up or down?
- What percentage of visitors register?
- What percentage of registered members participate?
- What percentage of those that participate are still active in 3 months time?
- What is the average number of contributions per month your top 1%, 9%, and 90% of members make?

### ReleasingBlogposts

- Major changes
- Something new
- Larger ecosystem effects

### NewslettersEmails

- Being time and date consistent when sending emails/newsletter to your users is crucial

### CommunityOrientedInitiatives

* Polls and surveys
* Community contests and challenges
* Community trainings

### CommunityForum

* Community Forum categories are super crucial for
  * People navigating to find potential solutions (not posting new ones)

### Hackathons

- Engagement with hackers after the event is super crucial in terms of your future events, especially when there are not many hackathons on the horizon
- Great customer service for your partners - acknowledgments and detailed reports about the event. The more detailed the better!
- Guidelines and booklets for your sponsors and partners before the event, regarding social media, promotion, the event are super useful for both you and your partners to keep consistency of your brand but also avoid fuckups!
- Team build - marking people with colorful stickers depending on their skills, nice idea, isn't it?
- Not revealing what prizes are and less or lack of travel reimbursments - competition is not what hackathons are about. Travel reimbursments -are you sure that you will get people who really care?
- Diversity and inclusion at your hackathons start with organizers!
- Arranging space - think of various adventures that you want to provide your hacker with (hacker journey during event)

### Meetups

- Meetups isn’t enough. What we need is an ongoing commitment to nurture a group with a shared identity
- Community need some shared space where they can meet after meetups
- Meetups rarely involve an exchange of value

### UserGroups

- Most people in user groups will never buy your product, but they will talk about your demo, spread your reputation, and praise your support
- Build the relationship before you need it

### Content

The best advice to seed your community before launching it is to set-up a longer beta or private invite-only period. You’ll be getting your best users and customer on board in the beginning — They’ll also be able to give you feedback on your community so you can tweak it before launching.

### CommunityProjects

* Don’t assume that you’ll launch the project and be done with it, but make a plan instead to maintain it, scale it and recruit others in the community to help keep it growing
* Make sure to recognize and reward community participation in your project! That’s essential to earning long-term commitment from maintainers and keeping your project welcoming and healthy.

### Notes

- Communicating with your customers over the course of their lifecycle to help them get to the outcome that they want
- Be as personal as possible, try not to communicate toward everyone
- Know your audience
- You need people who are skilled in managing user content, facilitating discussion, and overseeing the platform to build community
- Changes in community behaviour takes time (months, years)
- Understand community members at personal level
- As a Community Manager your job is to build up the community, not yourself. You succeed if and only if the community succeeds
- Guiding a community is stressful work. You have to hold yourself to the highest of standards while everyone else gets to be human
- It can be potentially good not to pitch your company during your own meetups. Do it for interested after the event
- Deleting content is generally safer than editing it
- Make sure everything you send developers in mail, makes their life better
- If you don't know an answer to a question in your FAQ, just say that
- Successful communities explicitly define what the expectations are towards each member. If every member knows what is expected, they can contribute accordingly (or choose not to)
- It's great to have an established workflow for handling social media community responses
- It's better to overcommunicate
- Connect with your audience:
    - Get personal (empathy)
    - Stay on target
    - Be reachable
    - **Pay huge attention to onboarding processes**
- Make your community indispensable to your organization
- It's not what you say in the meeting, it's what you bring to the meeting
- Make the community indispensable to your members
- Take a look at customer requests, and analyse them carefully. You want to distinguish between what customers ask for, and what they actually need
- Communicate with users to let them know that you're working on their issues. Even if it's not strictly speaking a docs issue, your communication skills can help product management and support reassure customers who are waiting for new features
- You shouldn’t forget your existing members. You need to ensure that they are still experiencing the value they were promised
- We should always be optimizing for developer joy
