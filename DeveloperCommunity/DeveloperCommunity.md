### Intro

- The community is about relying on others
- Community isn't something that you can control

### CommunityCanvas

### DeveloperWants

Developers want to:

- Find information quickly
- Have proof points
- Not face bad marketing

### CommunityPersonas

- **Consumers** in a community come with an expectation to be served: they attend events, at events they listen to speakers, in the online community they read or sometimes react to things, but usually only when it seems useful to them. If they don’t like something in the community, they complain or disengage. They feel that leading the community is someone else’s responsibility and they are mostly in the community for opportunistic reasons.

- **Co-creators** on the other hand actively shape events they go to or they help organize them. In discussions, both online and in person, they actively contribute new ideas and initiatives without expecting anything in return. If they don’t like something, they bring it up for discussion and provide new ideas and suggestions how to address it. If a conflict arises, they are willing to work through it. They invest their energy, time and money into the organization, because they feel that this community is partially also their own organization and therefore their responsibility to push it forward.

### CommunityLifecycle

- Inception
- Establishment
- Maturity
- Mitosis
- Death

### CommunityGettingStarted

- Identify target devs
- Say goodbye to inactive members on a regular basis
- Minimum commitment is expected from each member so set minimum expectations
- Identify their interests and motivations
- Remove barriers to adoption

### ImportantQuestions

- What makes your community unique?
- How do you help every member who joins your community immediately experience your uniqueness?

**Offering a new space to connect is no longer compelling on its own -> Conducting member research is crucial**

### CommunityOnboarding

- Make them feel welcomed and comfortable
- Give specific, simple steps to get started
- Don't overwhelm with too much info/tasks
- Over time interact in multiple ways
- Convey the culture and voice

### IncreasingParticipation

- Recognition and status boost
- Access to more info, tools, resources
- More capabilities and control
- Swag, cool stuff

### ReleasingBlogposts

- Major changes
- Something new
- Larger ecosystem effects

### NewslettersEmails

- Being time and date consistent when sending emails/newsletter to your users is crucial

### UserGroups

- Most people in user groups will never buy your product, but they will talk about your demo, spread your reputation, and praise your support
- Build the relationship before you need it

### Content

The best advice to seed your community before launching it is to set-up a longer beta or private invite-only period. You’ll be getting your best users and customer on board in the beginning — They’ll also be able to give you feedback on your community so you can tweak it before launching.

### Notes

- Communicating with your customers over the course of their lifecycle to help them get to the outcome that they want
- Be as personal as possible, try not to communicate toward everyone
- Know your audience
- Understand community members at personal level
- As a Community Manager your job is to build up the community, not yourself. You succeed if and only if the community succeeds
- Guiding a community is stressful work. You have to hold yourself to the highest of standards while everyone else gets to be human
- It can be potentially good not to pitch your company during your own meetups. Do it for interested after the event
- Deleting content is generally safer than editing it
- Make sure everything you send developers in mail, makes their life better
- If you don't know an answer to a question in your FAQ, just say that
- It's better to overcommunicate
- Connect with your audience:
    - Get personal (empathy)
    - Stay on target
    - Be reachable
    - **Pay huge attention to onboarding processes**
