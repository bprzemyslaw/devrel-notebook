### DeveloperWants

Developers want to:

- Find information quickly
- Have proof points
- Not face bad marketing

### CommunityLifecycle

- Inception
- Establishment
- Maturity
- Mitosis
- Death

### CommunityGettingStarted

- Identify target devs
- Say goodbye to inactive members on a regular basis
- Minimum commitment is expected from each member so set minimum expectations
- Identify their interests and motivations
- Remove barriers to adoption

### ImportantQuestions

- What makes your community unique?
- How do you help every member who joins your community immediately experience your uniqueness?

**Offering a new space to connect is no longer compelling on its own -> Conducting member research is crucial**

### CommunityOnboarding

- Make them feel welcomed and comfortable
- Give specific, simple steps to get started
- Don't overwhelm with too much info/tasks
- Over time interact in multiple ways
- Convey the culture and voice

### IncreasingParticipation

- Recognition and status boost
- Access to more info, tools, resources
- More capabilities and control
- Swag, cool stuff

### ReleasingBlogposts

- Major changes
- Something new
- Larger ecosystem effects

### NewslettersEmails

- Being time and date consistent when sending emails/newsletter to your users is crucial

### UserGroups

- Most people in user groups will never buy your product, but they will talk about your demo, spread your reputation, and praise your support
- Build the relationship before you need it

### Content

The best advice to seed your community before launching it is to set-up a longer beta or private invite-only period. You’ll be getting your best users and customer on board in the beginning — They’ll also be able to give you feedback on your community so you can tweak it before launching.

### Notes

- Communicating with your customers over the course of their lifecycle to help them get to the outcome that they want
- Be as personal as possible, try not to communicate toward everyone
- Know your audience
- Understand community members at personal level
- As a Community Manager your job is to build up the community, not yourself. You succeed if and only if the community succeeds
- Guiding a community is stressful work. You have to hold yourself to the highest of standards while everyone else gets to be human
- It can be potentially good not to pitch your company during your own meetups. Do it for interested after the event
- Deleting content is generally safer than editing it
- Make sure everything you send developers in mail, makes their life better
- If you don't know an answer to a question in your FAQ, just say that
- It's better to overcommunicate
- Connect with your audience:
    - Get personal (empathy)
    - Stay on target
    - Be reachable
    - **Pay huge attention to onboarding processes**
