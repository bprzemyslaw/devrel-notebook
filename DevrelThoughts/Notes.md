# DevRel Thoughts

* It will be perfect in the future to shift my developer relations careers with data science / machine learning skills
* After gaining developer relations experience it will be great to leverage that and become a developer relations consultant
* The way you gather DevRel data highly affect the results of the analysis later down the road
* It takes a ton of great communication and informatioon architecture to have great developer experience
- When you're asked about ROI and you think it's shit just don't come up with some number (**it's about trust**)
- Not everything of value can be measured
- To become better and advance in devrel world, I need to think in terms of product
- Talk about your career development plans whenever you feel like doing so
- When making products we should think about them that what we deliver is a finished even when delivery is incremental
- If you’re a great external communicator but you can’t get anything shipped for developers because you have no credibility with the product team, you aren’t becoming more senior in the organization.
