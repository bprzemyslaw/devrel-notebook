### DeveloperRoadmap

**Public Roadmaps** - by sharing in advance what youâ€™re planning with your users, you can help them make much smarter long-term decisions.

### Notes

- Hard to measure
- Subjective
- Time intensive
- Cost center
- Always stay bi-directional: care about your developers but also your internal team
- Before collecting data, build trust
- Do not tell people that something with your stack is not advisable, provide preventic solutions and error handling
- You cannot provide your developers with parts of the solution (developer mindset - they want to know all)
- Devs want to hear from each other
- If you want to talk with devrel guys you have to be the devrel guy
- Be reachable
