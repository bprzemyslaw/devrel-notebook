### DeveloperMarketing

- The Secret of Marketing to Developers is to Not Use Marketing
- There is no Developer Marketing, only teaching, inspiring, helping

### Swag

- Swag options:
  - Give out without requiring developer to do anything: extending the range of your community
  - Give out requiring to do something: encourage, build trust, create awareness

### Notes

- Hard to measure
- Subjective
- Developers are not only in US and Europe
- Time intensive
- Cost center
- Always stay bi-directional: care about your developers but also your internal team
- Before collecting data, build trust
- Do not tell people that something with your stack is not advisable, provide preventic solutions and error handling
- You cannot provide your developers with parts of the solution (developer mindset - they want to know all)
- Devs want to hear from each other
- If you want to talk with devrel guys you have to be the devrel guy
- Be reachable
- Sadly enough developers don't get much credit for their work and are generally considered “deliverers” rather than “thinkers”, which is simply not true.
- People working on products are actually not the right people to advocate them – they are far too close to the subject matter to find obvious flaws in the documentation or are fine with overly complex ways of invoking a certain functionality as they are used to them.
- Although charisma can be faked, DevRel also requires genuine enthusiasm for your platform or product.
- It takes time to get developers to love you. It requires trust building, living by their values, thinking and speaking like them. Do it for a long enough time so that they understand you are one of them. 
- If you're developing any kind of developer products you need to spend money on DevRel
