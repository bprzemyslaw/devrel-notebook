# Devrel Life Tips

- When you're traveling it can be hard to work out every day
  - Ensure a workout happens just about every day you're not on the road.
- Devrel job is a very flexible one so you need to make extra effort to make it more static
- Do not stay in front of the computer for more than 8 hours a day
- Make short breaks every 1.5 hour
- After finishing work: power off your notebook and leave it at home when going out
- Sometimes it’s worth getting on a call with people to talk about nothing. Just to see what’s up
- Remote workers shouldn’t feel guilty abut taking the time away from their desks
- Such conferences as GitHub Universe, Google IO are purely for networking
- If you're travelling for a conference always go for your health (even if they have talks that are interesting for you, choose the flight that allows you to get back home earlier and rest)
- Developer Advocacy - in some companies you need to travel 2/3 of the year
- Speaker dinners are very important for networking but also extending your social media outreach
- You need an event strategy and plan to execute (so as not to waste your attendance at the event)
