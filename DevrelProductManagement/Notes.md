### KPIs

Without a quantifiable sense of where you are vs. where you were, you can’t know (in any meaningful way) whether you’ve succeeded or not.

* Developer Community Product Manager KPIs
  * Followers / Members
  * Engagement (discussions / comments / shares / retweets / Re-Posts)
  * Referral traffic from your community
  * Number of new signups and discussions
  * Active members
  * Questions asked vs Questions answered

  Not everything you can measure, should be measured. Don’t be a data puker, be a data analyst. Be laser focused on the things that matter & provide actionable insights

### Notes

* There should be a right balance between KPIs / dashboards and interacting and listening to developer community
* Always try to learn something new
* Upgrade your users not your product
* Making users better at what they want to do not thinking what you want them to do
* Developers don't have much time
* They want to hack your product to their usecases
* Representation matters
